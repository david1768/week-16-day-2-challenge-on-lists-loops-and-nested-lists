# School Supply Order Tracking – Logic Challenge

## Objective
Students will apply their understanding of lists, nested lists, slicing, sorting, list grouping, and logical decision-making to solve a real-world data organization problem without using code.

---

## Scenario
You are helping the main office organize student supply requests for the week. Each request includes:

- Student name  
- Item requested  
- Quantity requested  

All requests must be stored together in one organized system.

---

## Student Tasks (No Coding – Logic Only)

### 1. Create Student Requests
Create a collection that stores information for **3 different student requests**.  
Each student request must include:
- Student name  
- Item requested  
- Quantity requested  

requests = [
    ["Ava", "Markers", 4],
    ["Jordan", "Notebooks", 7],
    ["Miles", "Glue Sticks", 2]
]

---

### 2. Identify Key Information
From your collection:
- Identify the **first student’s name**
- Identify the **last student’s requested item only**

first_student_name = requests[0][0]
last_student_item = requests[-1][1]

print("First student's name:", first_student_name)
print("Last student's requested item:", last_student_item)


---

### 3. Quantity Extraction
Create a **separate list that contains only the quantities requested** by the students.

quantities = [req[2] for req in requests]
print("Quantities only:", quantities)

---

### 4. Order Size Analysis
Analyze the quantities:
- If **any quantity is greater than 5**, label the order:
  “Large order detected!”
- Otherwise label the order:
  “Orders within normal limits.”
if any(q > 5 for q in quantities):
    print("Large order detected!")
else:
    print("Orders within normal limits.")


---

### 5. Quantity Organization
Re-organize the quantity list from **smallest to largest** and display the final result.
sorted_quantities = sorted(quantities)
print("Quantities sorted:", sorted_quantities)

## Challenge Extension: Classroom Storage Grid

You are also given a grid showing classroom supply counts:

Classroom 1: 8, 12, 5  
Classroom 2: 7, 3, 9  
Classroom 3: 10, 6, 4  

Answer the following:

1. What is the **middle number** in the second classroom’s list? 
         7
2. Create a new list that extracts **only the last number** from each classroom. 

classrooms = [
    [8, 12, 5],
    [7, 3, 9],
    [10, 6, 4]
]

last_numbers = [room[-1] for room in classrooms]

print(last_numbers)


3. Explain **why this information must be stored as a nested structure instead of a single list.** 
because each class has its own members and it makes it more simple and understandable 

---

## What This Assignment Tests
- Understanding how grouped data is stored
- Nested structure reasoning
- Data extraction using position
- Organizational logic
- Real-world decision-making with quantities

---

## Submission Requirements
- All answers must be written in words and/or tables.
- No programming code may be used.
- Show clear reasoning for each response.

---

## Academic Integrity
This is an individual logic and reasoning task. All work must be your own.
